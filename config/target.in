      GCC uses this name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit
      when generating assembly code. This option can be used in conjunction
      with or instead of the ARCH_CPU option (above), or a (command-line)
      -mcpu= option.
      
      This is the configuration flag --with-arch=XXXX, and the runtime flag
      -march=XXX.
      
      Pick a value from the gcc manual for your choosen gcc version and your
      target CPU.
      
      Leave blank if you don't know, or if your target architecture does not
      offer this option.

      Generate code for the given ABI.

      This is the configuration flag --with-abi=XXXX, and the runtime flag
      -mabi=XXX.

      Pick a value from the gcc manual for your choosen gcc version and your
      target CPU.

      Leave blank if you don't know, or if your target architecutre does not
      offer this option.

    help
      This specifies the name of the target processor. GCC uses this name
      to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
      assembly code.
      
      This is the configuration flag --with-cpu=XXXX, and the runtime flag
      -mcpu=XXX.

      Pick a value from the gcc manual for your choosen gcc version and your
      target CPU.

      offer this option.

    depends on ARCH_SUPPORT_TUNE
    default ""
    help
      This option is very similar to the ARCH_CPU option (above), except
      that instead of specifying the actual target processor type, and hence
      restricting which instructions can be used, it specifies that GCC should
      tune the performance of the code as if the target were of the type
      specified in this option, but still choosing the instructions that it
      will generate based on the cpu specified by the ARCH_CPU option
      (above), or a (command-line) -mcpu= option.
      
      This is the configuration flag --with-tune=XXXX, and the runtime flag
      -mtune=XXX.
      
      Pick a value from the gcc manual for your choosen gcc version and your
      target CPU.

    help
      On some targets (eg. ARM), you can specify the kind of FPU to emit
      code for.

      This is the configuration flag --with-fpu=XXX, and the runtime flag
      -mfpu=XXX.
      
      See below wether to actually emit FP opcodes, or to emulate them.
      
      Pick a value from the gcc manual for your choosen gcc version and your
      target CPU.
      
      Leave blank if you don't know, or if your target architecture does not
      offer this option.

    help
      Emit hardware floating point opcodes.
      
      If you've got a processor with a FPU, then you want that.
      If your hardware has no FPU, you still can use HW floating point, but
      need to compile support for FPU emulation in your kernel. Needless to
      say that emulating the FPU is /slooowwwww/...
      
      One situation you'd want HW floating point without a FPU is if you get
      binary blobs from different vendors that are compiling this way and
      can't (don't wan't to) change.

config ARCH_FLOAT_SW
    bool
    prompt "software"
    help
      Do not emit any hardware floating point opcode.
      
      If your processor has no FPU, then you most probably want this, as it
      is faster than emulating the FPU in the kernel.
