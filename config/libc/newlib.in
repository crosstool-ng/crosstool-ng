    help
      Newlib is a C library intended for use on embedded systems. It is a
      conglomeration of several library parts, all under free software
      licenses that make them easily usable on embedded products. Newlib
      is only available in source form. It can be compiled for a wide
      array of processors, and will usually work on any architecture with
      the addition of a few low-level routines.

      The newlib "team" rolls new releases about once a year (december).
      This is quite a long time between releases, in case code was fixed.
      
      Saying 'Y' here will allow you to use the bleeding-edge code from
      the CVS repository. This may or may not fix your issues, may or may
      not build, may or may not crash your machine, may or may not withdraw
      money from your bank account, may or may not date your girlfriend,
      may or may not resurect Elvis... :-)
      
      In a word: use the CVS snapshot at your own risk!

      Enter the tag you want to use.
      Leave empty to use the 'head' of the repository.

      Install Atmel AVR32 headers for native AVR32 development. Most
      AVR32 MCU devices are supported.
      
      If you do native AVR32 development you want to say 'Y' here.
