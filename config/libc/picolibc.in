## help Picolibc is a C library intended for use on embedded systems. It is a
## help conglomeration of several library parts, all under BSD-compatible software
## help licenses that make them easily usable on embedded products. Picolibc
## help is only available in source form. It can be compiled for a wide
## help array of processors, and will usually work on any architecture with
## help the addition of a few low-level routines.

config PICOLIBC_CXA_ATEXIT
    def_bool y
    select LIBC_PROVIDES_CXA_ATEXIT

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_TARGET_CFLAGS
    string
    prompt "Target CFLAGS for picolibc"
    default ""
    help
      Used to add specific options when compiling the target libraries
      (eg. -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections), which can't be defined
      in global TARGET_CFLAGS, because they shall be not used for the
      gcc target libraries.
      Note:  Both TARGET_CFLAGS and LIBC_PICOLIBC_TARGET_CFLAGS are used
             to compile the libraries.

      Leave blank if you don't know better.

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_IO_C99FMT
    bool
    prompt "Enable IOs on C99 formats"
    default y
    help
      Enable support for IOs on C99 formats.

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_REGISTER_FINI
    bool
    prompt "Enable finalization function registration using atexit"
    help
        Enable finalization function registration using atexit.

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_ATEXIT_DYNAMIC_ALLOC
    bool
    prompt "Enable dynamic allocation of atexit entries"
    help
        Enable dynamic allocation of atexit entries.

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_GLOBAL_ATEXIT
    bool
    prompt "Enable atexit data structure as global variable"
    help
        Enable atexit data structure as global variable, instead
	of being thread-local.

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_LITE_EXIT
    bool
    prompt "Enable lite exit"
    default y
    help
        Enable lite exit, a size-reduced implementation of exit that doesn't
        invoke clean-up functions such as _fini or global destructors.

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_MULTITHREAD
    bool
    prompt "Enable support for multiple threads"
    default y
    help
        Enable support for multiple threads.

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_RETARGETABLE_LOCKING
    bool
    prompt "Enable retargetable locking"
    help
        Enable retargetable locking to allow the operating system to override
        the dummy lock functions defined within picolibc.

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_EXTRA_SECTIONS
    bool
    prompt "Place each function & data element in their own section"
    help
        Place each function & data symbol in their own section. This allows
        the linker to garbage collect unused symbols at link time.

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_ENABLE_TARGET_OPTSPACE
    bool
    prompt "Optimize picolibc for size"
    default y
    help
      Pass --enable-target-optspace to picolibc configure.

      This will compile picolibc with -Os.

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_LTO
    bool
    prompt "Enable Link Time Optimization"
    depends on CC_GCC_USE_LTO
    help
      Builds the libraries with -flto to enable more aggressive link time
      optimization. You will need to add -flto-partition=one to your
      application's link line to keep the RETURN assembler macro together
      with it's consumers.

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_NANO_MALLOC
    bool
    prompt "Enable Nano Malloc"
    default y
    help
      PICOLIBC has two implementations of malloc family's functions, one in
      `mallocr.c' and the other one in `nano-mallocr.c'.  This options
      enables the nano-malloc implementation, which is for small systems
      with very limited memory.  Note that this implementation does not
      support `--enable-malloc-debugging' any more.

config LIBC_PICOLIBC_EXTRA_CONFIG_ARRAY
    string
    prompt "Extra config for picolibc"
    default ""
    help
      Extra flags to pass to meson when configuring picolibc.
