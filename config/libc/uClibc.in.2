      From the uClibc config option help:
        There are two versions of linuxthreads.  The older (stable) version
        has been in uClibc for quite a long time but hasn't seen too many
        updates other than bugfixes.

    help
      From the uClibc config option help:
        The new version has not been tested much, and lacks ports for arches
        which glibc does not support (like frv, etc...), but is based on
        the latest code from glibc, so it may be the only choice for the
        newer ports (like alpha/amd64/64bit arches and hppa).

      Say y if you want uClibc to support localisation.

      Note that seems to be broken on recent uClibc releases.

      If you see issues with using pre-generated locales data,
      you can try switching this off.

      If so, please report the issue, so we can default this
      to off if too many people complain.

      Say y if you want uClibc to support WCHAR.

      Maybe this is needed, if you're building a C++-Compiler

    help
      fenv.h provides functions to control the floating point environment,
      such as rounding mode, exceptions...

      For some architectures, fenv.h is incomplete, so is not installed
      by default. x86 is known to have a rather complete fenv.h, so it is
      installed by default only for x86.

      If you need fenv.h on other architectures, say 'y' here, but you may
      encounter some issues.
