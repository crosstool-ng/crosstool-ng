      Until end of Februrary 2009, there was no tarball for glibc releases
      2.8 and later. This was intentional.
      
      Then, all of a sudden, tarballs for those releases have appeared at the
      traditional download place (ftp.gnu.org).
      
      Some of the glibc people argue that fixes are committed to the maintenance
      branch, and thus it is the best plac e to retrieve the glibc from.
      On the other hand, it might be preferable to always generate a toolchain
      using a known code-base, so the toolchain can be reproducible.
      
      For version prior to 2.8, tarballs were readily available.
      
      If you want your toolchain to really be reproducible, say 'Y' here.
      If you can live with a moving code-base, look at the other choice
      entries, below.
