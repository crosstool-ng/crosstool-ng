      Use the 'shinny new' sysroot feature of gcc: libraries split between
      prefix/target/sys-root/lib and prefix/target/sys-root/usr/lib
      
      You definitely want to say 'Y' here. Yes you do. I know you do. Say 'Y'.

      This string will be interpreted as a directory component to be added
      to the sysroot path, just before the actual sysroot directory.
      
      In fact, the sysroot path is constructed as:
        ${CT_PREFIX_DIR}/${CT_TARGET}/${CT_SYSROOT_DIR_PREFIX}/sys-root

config TARGET_VENDOR

    help
      Vendor part of the target tuple.
      
      A tuple is of the form arch-vendor-kernel-system.
      You can set the second part, vendor, to whatever you see fit.
      Use a single word, or use underscores "_" to separate words.
      Use neither dash nor space, as it breaks things.
      
      Keep the default (unkown) if you don't know better.

config TARGET_ALIAS_SED_EXPR
    string
    prompt "Tuple's sed transform"
    default ""
    help
      Normaly, you'd call your toolchain components (especially gcc) by
      prefixing the target tuple followed by a dash and the component name
      (eg. armeb-unknown-linux-uclibc-gcc).
      
      You can enter here a sed expression to be applied to ${CT_TARGET} to
      create an alias for your toolchain.
      
      For example, "s/${CT_TARGET_VENDOR}/foobar/" (without the double quotes)
      will create the armeb-foobar-linux-uclibc alias to the above-mentioned
      toolchain.
      
      You shouldn't need to enter anything here, unless you plan to manually
      call the tools (autotools-based ./configure will use the standard name).

config TARGET_ALIAS
    string
    prompt "Tuple's alias"
    default ""
    help
      Normaly, you'd call your toolchain components (especially gcc) by
      prefixing the target tuple followed by a dash and the component name
      (eg. armeb-unknown-linux-uclibc-gcc).
      
      You can enter a shortcut here. This string will be used to create
      symbolic links to the toolchain tools (eg. if you enter "foo-bar" here,
      then gcc for your toolchain will also be available as "foo-bar-gcc" along
      with the original name).
      
      You shouldn't need to enter anything here, unless you plan to manually
      call the tools (autotools-based ./configure will use the standard name).

      If you have your *build system* tools in a weird location, and/or
      they have an unusual prefix, enter it here.
      
      Usually, you should leave that empty!
      
      Eg.:
        If your *build* gcc is /opt/build-tools/bin/weird-gcc then you
        should enter:
            /opt/build-tools/bin/weird-
        
        If your *build* gcc is /opt/build-tools/bin/weird-gcc and
        /opt/build-tools/bin is in your PATH, you should enter:
            weird-
        
        If your *build* gcc is /opt/build-tools/bin/gcc then you
        should enter (do not forget to add the trailing '/'):

config BUILD_SUFFIX
    string
    prompt "|  Tools suffix (READ HELP!)"
    default ""
    help
      If your *build system* tools have an unusual suffix, enter it
      here.
      
      Usually, you should leave that empty!
      
      Eg.:
        If your 'default' gcc is gcc 4.3.1, but you also have gcc-3.4.2
        installed as gcc-3.4, then you should enter:
            -3.4
      
      It can happen that some of the tools have a suffix, when others
      don't, eg. you can have 'gcc-3.4' and 'ar'. crosstool-NG accounts
      for that by checking the tools without the suffix in case it can
      not find some of the tool.
