      gcc 4.3.0 and above requires both GMP and MPFR to build some frontends,
      and some other components can use them as well.
      
      These will be automatically selected if you choose gcc>=4.3.0, but you
      can say 'Y' here if you want to build those two libraries for the other
      components (that don't select them by default).
      
      The packages that can use GMP and MPFR are:
        - binutils
        - gcc
        - gdb

      gcc-4.4.0 and above requires PPL and CLooG/PPL to build some parts
      of the optimiser (GRAPHITE loop optimisation, to be precise).
      
      In addition to those, gcc-4.4 also optionally uses MPC to enable
      additional optimisations on complex numbers. Although MPC is optional,
      crosstool-NG requires it and uses it to build gcc >= 4.4.0.
      
      These will be automatically selected if you choose gcc>=4.4.0, but you
      can say 'Y' here, although it is unknown yet if any other component
      can use them.

      It is highly recommended to check the newly built companion libraries.
      Unfortunately, this is a very intensive task, and takes a loooong time.

      Checking the newly built companion libraries is thus disabled by default,
      but it is suggested that you check them at least once on your machine,
      and if they work, disable the check on subsequent builds.

      If you suspect that one (or more) of your companion libraries is the
      cause for incorrectly generated code, you should answer 'Y' here.
      Note however that this will take a really long time. For example,
      building PPL on my machine takes roughly 1'40", while checking it takes
      about 1h30"...

      Also build companion libraries for the target. This can be usefull if
      you want to later build a compiler that will run on the target, or if
      you want to run gdb natively on the target.
      
      Please note that for now, crosstool-NG can only build GMP and MPFR so.
