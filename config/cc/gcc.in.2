      Leave empty if you don't know better.

      Extra flags to pass onto ./configure when configuring the core gcc.
      
      The core gcc is a stripped down, C-only compiler needed to build
      the C library. Kinda bootstrap gcc, if you wish.
      
      You can enter multiple arguments here, and arguments can contain spaces
      if they are properly quoted (or escaped, but prefer quotes). Eg.:

config CC_GCC_TARGET_FINAL

    depends on BARE_METAL
    help
      The final GCC for a bare metal system is built by the core gcc script.
      This script does a lot of tricks to build the core gcc, which are not
      required for the final gcc build. If you set this flag to true, all the
      tricks are not done and the compiler is build with all/install.

    select WANTS_STATIC_LINK
    help
      Newer gcc versions use the PPL library which is C++ code.  Statically
      linking libstdc++ increases the likeliness that the gcc binary will
      run on machines other than the one which it was built on, without
      having to worry about distributing the matching version of libstdc++
      along with it.

config CC_GCC_SYSTEM_ZLIB
    bool
    prompt "Use system zlib"
    help
      Do not use bundled zlib, and use the zlib already available for
      the host (eg. the system library).
      
      If you want to build a static toolchain, you will need to also
      install the static version of zlib for your host.
      
      If unsure, say 'n'.

# The way LTO works is a bit twisted.
# See: http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/LinkTimeOptimization#Requirements
# Basically:
#   - if binutils has plugins: LTO is handled by ld/gold by loading
#     the plugin when linking
#   - if binutils does not have plugins: LTO is handled by collect2
# In any case, LTO support does not depend on plugins, but takes
# advantage of it
# Also, only the 4.5 series needs libelf for LTO; 4.6 has dropped
# the dependency.

    help
      libmudflap is a pointer-use checking tool, which can detect
      various mis-usages of pointers in C and (to some extents) C++.
      
      You should say 'N' here, as libmduflap generates instrumented
      code (thus it is a bit bigger and a bit slower) and requires
      re-compilation and re-link, while it exists better run-time
      alternatives (eg. DUMA, dmalloc...) that need neither re-
      compilation nor re-link.

    help
      Say 'y' here to not use Pre-Compiled Headers in the resulting toolchain.
      at the expense of speed when compiling C++ code.
      
      For some configurations (most notably canadian?), PCH are broken, and

    help
      'sjlj' is short for setjmp/longjmp.
      
      On some architectures, stack unwinding during exception handling
      works perfectly well without using sjlj, while on some others,
      use of sjlj is required for proper stack unwinding.
      
       Option  | sjlj use           | Associated ./configure switch
      ---------+--------------------+--------------------------------
         Y     | forcibly used      | --enable-sjlj-exceptions
         M     | auto               | (none, ./configure decides)
         N     | forcibly not used  | --disable-sjlj-exceptions
      
      It should be safe to say 'M' or 'N'.
      
      It can happen that ./configure is wrong in some cases. Known
      case is for ARM big endian, where you should say 'N'.

      Saying 'Y' will force gcc to use 128-bit wide long doubles
      Saying 'N' will force gcc to use 64-bit wide long doubles
      Saying 'M' will let gcc choose (default is 128-bit for
                 glibc >= 2.4, 64-bit otherwise)
      
      If in doubt, keep the default, ie. 'M'.

      Tells GCC to pass --build-id option to the linker for all final

      if the linker supports it. If you say 'y' here, but your linker
      does not support --build-id option, a warning is issued and this
      option is ignored.

      Choose what type of decimal floats to support.
      
      Note that using decimal floats requires a C library that provides
      support for fenv (namely, the fenv.h header).  This is the case
      for (e)glibc, and uClibc on x86/32.  For other C libraries, or
      uClibc on other archs, this might not be the case, so you should
      disable support for decimal floats.
