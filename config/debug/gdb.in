    help
      A static cross gdb can be usefull if you debug on a machine that is
      not the one that is used to compile the toolchain.
      
      That way, you can share the cross-gdb without installing a toolchain
      on every machine that will be used to debug target programs.

    help
      If you say 'Y' here, then Insight will be used to build the cross
      debugger, instead of the plain gdb.
      
      Insight is gdb plus a TCL/TK GUI: http://sourceware.org/insight/

config GDB_NATIVE

    default n

    help
      In case you have trouble with dynamic loading of shared libraries,
      you will find that a static gdb comes in handy.

config GDB_NATIVE_USE_GMP_MPFR
    bool
    prompt "Use GMP and MPFR"
    default n

    select COMP_LIBS_TARGET
    help
      gdb can make use of the GMP and MPFR libraries.
      
      While the cross-gdb (above) can use the libraries compiled for the
      host, the native gdb needs the libraries for the target (where it will
      eventually run).
      
      Setting this option will force building the GMP and MPFR libraries for
      the target, and configure the native gdb to use them.

config GDB_GDBSERVER
    bool
    prompt "gdbserver"
    default n
    depends on ! BARE_METAL

      Build and install a gdbserver for the target, to run on the target.
