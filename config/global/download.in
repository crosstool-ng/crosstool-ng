    help
      Normally, crosstool-NG will try to download missing tarballs (or
      checkout from CVS/SVN...).
      If you do not have network connectivity when you run crosstool-NG,
      and some files are missing, it can be a long time before crosstool-NG
      fails.
      
      Saying 'y' here will prevent crosstool-NG from downloading missing
      files, thus failing early so that you don't get stuck.

config FORCE_DOWNLOAD
    bool
    prompt "Force downloads"
    help
      Force downloading tarballs, even if one already exists.
      
      Useful if you suspect a tarball to be damaged.

config CONNECT_TIMEOUT
    int
    prompt "Connection timeout"
    default 10
    help
      From the curl manual:
        Maximum time in seconds that you allow the connection to the server to take.
      
      The scenario is as follows;
        - some enterprise networks have firewalls that prohibit FTP traffic, while
          still allowing HTTP
        - most download sites have http:// equivalent for the ftp:// URL
        - after this number of seconds, it is considered that the connection could
          not be established, and the next URL in the list is tried, until we reach
          an URL that will go through the firewall, most probably an http:// URL.
      
      If you have a slow network, you'd better set this value higher than the default
      10s. If you know a firewall is blocking connections, but your network is globally
      fast, you can try to lower this value to jump more quickly to allowed URLs. YMMV.
      
      Note that this value applies equally to wget if you have that installed.

config ONLY_DOWNLOAD
    bool
    prompt "Stop after downloading tarballs"
    help
      Only download the tarballs. Exit once it done.
      
      Useful to pre-retrieve the tarballs before going off-line.

config USE_MIRROR
    bool
    prompt "Use a mirror"
    help
      If you have a machine on your LAN that mirrors some of the needed
      tarballs, you can say 'Y' here, and configure adequate values in
      the following options.
      
      Obviously, nothing prevents you from using a mirror that is in fact
      *not* on your LAN, for example on another subnet of your company's
      network, or a mirror on the Internet.

config MIRROR_BASE_URL
    string
    prompt "Base URL"
    depends on USE_MIRROR
    default "http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/mirrors/"
    help
      This is the base URL searched in for tarballs.
      
      I (Yann E. MORIN) have set up such a mirror to host snapshots of
      some components, when those snapshots are volatile on the upstream
      servers. The mirror is *slow*, because it is hosted behind an ADSL
      line. For the time being, I haven't set up bandwidth limitations,
      but should the mirror be abused, I will. Please avoid using my
      machine when you can... Also, no guarantee is made as to its
      availability. Use at your own risks.
      
      The mirror is available at:
        http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/mirrors/
