    bool

    default LOG_INFO if !DEBUG_CT
    default LOG_DEBUG if DEBUG_CT

config LOG_ERROR
    bool
    prompt "ERROR"
    help
      The build will be silent.
      Only if there is an error will you see a message.

config LOG_WARN
    bool
    prompt "WARN"
    help
      The same as above, plus warnings.

config LOG_INFO
    bool
    prompt "INFO"
    help
      The same as above, plus informational messages (main steps).

config LOG_EXTRA
    bool
    prompt "EXTRA"
    help
      The same as above, plus extra messages (sub-steps).

config LOG_ALL
    bool
    prompt "ALL"
    help
      The same as above, plus all components build messages (very noisy!).

config LOG_DEBUG
    bool
    prompt "DEBUG"
    help
      The same as above, plus lots of crosstool-NG debug information.

config LOG_LEVEL_MAX
    string
    default "ERROR"   if LOG_ERROR
    default "WARN"    if LOG_WARN
    default "INFO"    if LOG_INFO
    default "EXTRA"   if LOG_EXTRA
    default "ALL"     if LOG_ALL
    default "DEBUG"   if LOG_DEBUG

config LOG_SEE_TOOLS_WARN
    bool
    prompt "Warnings from the tools' builds"
    depends on ! LOG_ERROR
    help
      Treat warnings from the different tools as crosstool-NG warnings.
      If you say 'y' here, then those warnings will be prefixed with
      '[WARN ]' instead of the default '[ALL  ]'.

      You can safely say 'n' here. Those warnings will anyway be
      recorded in the log file (provided you configured one).

      Tools error will always be logged as crosstool-NG errors.

config LOG_PROGRESS_BAR
    bool
    prompt "Progress bar"
    default y
    depends on ! LOG_ALL && ! LOG_DEBUG && ! AUTOMATED_BUILD
    help
      If you say 'y' here, you'll be able to see the elapsed time.
      
      As a bonus, you'll also get a rotating bar (/-\|) showing you
      that the build is not stalled (the bar rotates 1/4 every 10 lines
      of components build log).

      Note that the elapsed time can stall for a little while if a
      component has long commands, as the elapsed time is only updated
      each line.

config LOG_TO_FILE
    bool
    prompt "Log to a file"
    default y
    help
      Save *full* logs to a file. Even log levels you didn't specify above
      will be available in this file. The log file will be named build.log
      and stored in the toolchain prefix dir (set above).

      Definitely, say Y.

config LOG_FILE_COMPRESS
    bool
    prompt "Compress the log file"
    default y
    depends on LOG_TO_FILE
    help
      Compress the log file once the toolchain is successfully built.

config AUTOMATED_BUILD
    bool
    default y
    depends on CONFIGURE_has_automated
