      Enter the date of the snapshot you want to use in the form: YYYYMMDD
      where YYYY is the 4-digit year, MM the 2-digit month and DD the 2-digit
      day in the month.
      
      Please note:
      - glibc has snapshots done every monday, and only the last ten are kept.
      - uClibc has daily snapshots, and only the last 30-or-so are kept.
      
      So if you want to be able to re-build your toolchain later, you will
      have to save your C library tarball by yourself.

      Say 'Y' here if you want to have a ldd-like helper that
      you can run on your build system, and that will (try to)
      resolve shared libraries dependencies as if run on the
      target.
      
      Note that the cross-ldd helper is not a full replacement
      for the native ldd. Please see the help, by running it
      with '--help' for more explanations.
