  assert (info[DT_RPATH] == NULL);
in glibc-2.3.2's ld.so, which makes all dynamically-linked
programs crash.

I've grepped gcc/config/*/*.h and found only SH and old libc1 stuffs
of i386/alpha include %{!rpath:-rpath ... in 3.3 release and the
current CVS. And my sh-gcc's specs doesn't have this :-(
It would be the Right Thing to remove this stuff simply. How about
the gcc patch below?
