This is a somewhat ordered TODO list:

Recuring tasks:

- update versions for every tools...

- update and/or upgrade all samples


Non-recurring tasks:

- update newlib (for enhanced bare metal)
  - confirm existing implementation on targets other than AVR32
  - try to make it generic, will help for uClibc++

- multilib

- Cygwin target (needs newlib)
  - so we can build toolchains that generate code for Windows/Cygwin

- Cygwin host
  - so we can build toolchains that run natively under Windows/Cygwin

- mingw32 target
  - so we can build toolchains that generate code for Windows/Win32

- mingw32 host
  - so we can build toolchains that run natively under Windows/Win32
    (without requiring Cygwin)

- uClibc++
  - see newlib, above

- uClinux
  - check whether we can use newlib under uClinux (?)
