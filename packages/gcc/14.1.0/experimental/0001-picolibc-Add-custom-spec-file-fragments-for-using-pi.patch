Subject: [PATCH] picolibc: Add custom spec file fragments for using
 picolibc

The '--oslib=' option allows targets to insert an OS library after the
C library in the LIB_PATH spec file fragment. This library maps a few
POSIX APIs used by picolibc to underlying system capabilities.

The '--crt0=' option allows targets to use an alternate crt0 in place
of the usual one as provided by Picolibc.

For example, picolibc provides 'libsemihost' and 'crt0-semihost.o' on
various targets which maps some POSIX APIs to semihosting capabilities
and signals the semihosting environment when 'main' returns. These
would be used by specifying --oslib=semihost --crt0=semihost.

This patch also takes advantage of the IN_GPP conditional when
building g++ to elide exception handling contents from the executable
when not linking with the g++ driver.
