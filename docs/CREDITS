I would like to thank these fine people for making crosstool-NG possible:

  Dan KEGEL, the original author of crosstool: http://www.kegel.com/
    Dan was very helpfull and willing to help when I build my first toolchains.
    I owe him one. Thank you Dan!
    Some crosstool-NG scripts have code snippets coming almost as-is from the
    original work by Dan.

And in order of appearance on the crossgcc ML:

  Allan CLARK for his investigations on building toolchains on MacOS-X.
    Allan made extensive tests of the first alpha of crosstool-NG on his
    MacOS-X, and unveiled some bash-2.05 weirdness.

  Enrico WEIGELT
    - some improvements to the build procedure
    - cxa_atexit disabling for C libraries not supporting it (old uClibc)
    - misc suggestions (restartable build, ...)
    - get rid of some bashisms in ./configure

  Robert P. J. DAY:
    - some small improvements to the configurator, misc prompting glitches
    - 'sanitised' patches for binutils-2.17
    - patches for glibc-2.5
    - misc patches, typos and eye candy
    - too many to list any more!

  Al Stone:
    - initial ia64 support
    - some cosmetics

  Szilveszter Ordog:
    - a uClibc floating point fix
    - initial support for ARM EABI

  Mark Jonas:
    - initiated Super-H port

  Michael Abbott:
    - make it build with ancient findutils

  Willy Tarreau:
    - a patch to glibc to build on 'ancient' shells
    - reported mis-use of $CT_CC_NATIVE

  Matthias Kaehlcke:
    - fix building glibc-2.7 (and 2.6.1) with newer kernels

  Many others have contributed, either in form of patches, suggestions,
  comments, or testing... Thank you to all of you!

Special dedication to the buildroot people for maintaining a set of patches I
happily and shamelessly vampirise from time to time... :-)

More to come as they help.
