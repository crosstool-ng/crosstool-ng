    - Preparing for packaging
    - Shell completion
    - Contributed code

3- Configuring a toolchain
    - Interesting config options
    - Re-building an existing toolchain
    - Using as a backend for a build-system

4- Building the toolchain
    - Stopping and restarting a build
    - Testing all toolchains at once
    - Overriding the number of // jobs
    - Note on // jobs
    - Tools wrapper

5- Using the toolchain
    - The 'populate' script

6- Toolchain types
    - Seemingly-native toolchains

7- Contributing
    - Sending a bug report
    - Sending patches

8- Internals
    - Makefile front-end
    - Kconfig parser
    - Architecture-specific
    - Adding a new version of a component
    - Build scripts

9 - How is a toolchain constructed?
    - I want a cross-compiler! What is this toolchain you're speaking about?
    - So, what are those components in a toolchain?
    - And now, how do all these components chained together?
    - So the list is complete. But why does crosstool-NG have more steps?
