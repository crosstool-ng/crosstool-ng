Description: create your own cross toolchains
 Crosstool-NG aims at building toolchains. Toolchains are an essential
 component in a software development project. It will compile, assemble and
 link the code that is being developed.
 .
 The usual toolchain is called "native" and is in packages
 like 'clang' and 'gcc' (This package is not needed for doing
 native development).
 .
 This package is for generating toolchains when doing development
 on a foreign architecture (when you need a cross compiler).
