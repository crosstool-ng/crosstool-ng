## Testing Docker Images Policy

To avoid proliferation of versions, the following policy is adopted for
which distro docker images are used for testing: the oldest LTS release
still receiving maintenance updates + the most recent release for
distributions that offer LTS releases.

For distros without LTS releases the latest version will be supported.
